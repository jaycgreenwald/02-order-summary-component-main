## My process

I began by designing the mobile version first. I used Adobe Illustrator to measure distances for the layout. Then I moved to the desktop version. For QA, I viewed the site in Chrome and Firefox. I used Illustrator to compare the coded version with the design image.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Love

### What I learned

I learned that it's much better to go slow and complete a section or chunk instead of jumping around.
I dug into selectors and combinators a little more deeply.
I learned some tips for creating drop shadows.

### Continued development

I would like to review flexbox.

### Useful resources

- [Designing Beautiful Shadows in CSS](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/designing-shadows/) - I had little experience creating drop shadows in CSS. This provided some great tips such as creating shadows using one single light source for the entire page.
